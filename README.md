<h1>Stack Adapter</h1>
<hr>
<i> <br>In C++, a stack adapter is a class template that adapts an existing container class to provide the functionality of a stack. </br>
A stack is a data structure that follows the last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle. 
That means the last element added to the stack will be the first element to be removed.</i>
<hr>
<b>
The stack adapter in C++ is implemented using the Standard Template Library (STL) and can be based on any container class, 
such as vector, deque, or list.
The stack adapter provides an easy-to-use interface for working with a stack, including functions such as push(), pop(), and top(), 
which allow elements to be added or removed from the stack, and to access the top element of the stack.</b>
<hr>
If you want to compile this code.
You must...


```
g++ -std=c++2a main.cpp stack.hpp
```

and then if you want to run this code you must write

```
./a.out 

```
